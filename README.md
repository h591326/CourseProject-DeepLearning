# CourseProject-DeepLearning : Chest X-rays

The application, idea and the motivation behind making this project, comes from a project in the course catalog from a course I had this semester called DAT255 Deep Learning. The project stated the following and gave me the instruction and motivation I needed to start on my project.


INTRODUCTION

Identifying and assessing structures in the lung from X-ray scans of the chest is an essential task across multiple diseases involving the lungs and upper abdomen, e.g., lung cancer infections, pnemonia, broken ribs, and more. X-ray images can provide a detailed view of the lungs surrounding structures, making it possible to detect, analyze, monitor and assess treatment response. Computer-aided diagnostic tools addressing chest X-rays are important in medical imaging, possibly increasing speed, accuracy, consistency, and cost-effectiveness.

The goal for the project consisted of two smaller goals. One, create a deep learning system to detect one or more of 14 conditions directly from one or more chest X-rays. And two, investigate and apply techniques for "Explainable AI". 


DISCLOSER

Before I start explaining my progress and how I worked, I would like to point out that I did not achieve as great a success with my deep learning model as I hoped. I have tried many times during this semester to make a good classifier to make the training more efficient and have a higher accuracy on the validation set for making predictions. This I was not successful with, so I tried making multiple classifiers during this duration of the project before it was due. So, what I decided to do was to deliver my progress so far: my best classifiers for if a patient has Pneumothorax (punctured lung) or not and my progress so far on my multilabel classifier. 

So please, if you are going to recreate my research and model, take into consideration my mistakes (elaborated in my project report) and I recommend using a different version of the datasets that I used, and always tripple or quadruple check the lables of the images. Otherwise you'll end up recreating my mistakes identically. 

For more information or argumentation to my different approaches and choises I made, please look at my project report.
